    <h2>Sigops Coding Style</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
    This is a list of sigops coding style guidelines that should be used
    wherever possible on AlectOS.
    </p>

    Guidelines:
    <ul>
      <li>
      Spaces should be used instead of actual tab characters ('\t').  In vim,
      you can use ':set expandtab' to do this automatically.
      </li>

      <li>
      Three spaces should be used for tabs.  This corresponds to ':set
      shiftwidth=3' and ':set tabstop=3' in vim.
      </li>

      <li>
      We are using "pseudo-bastard style" for indenting.  This was chosen after
      a big argument as a reasonable compromise.  To show you what I mean by
      "pseudo-bastard style" look below:
      <pre>
        if (someval == someconst)
        {
           /* level 1 of indenting */

           if (retval)
           {
              /* nested indent */
           }
        }
      </pre>
      Basically, don't put the open brace on the same line that starts a block.
      And no matter what you do, DO NOT use GNU style brain-dead indenting.
      Anybody caught indenting in this manner will be shot and hung.
      </li>

      <li>
      Comments are fairly free form, but there are a couple of things that will
      make the code much more readable.
      <ul>
        <li>
        Put a space between the opening and ending of a comment and any text
        in the comment.  ie:
        <pre>
          // correct
          /* correct */

          //not good
          /*not good*/
        </pre>
        </li>

        <li>
        Multi-line comments should be done with c-style comments, NOT c++ style
        comments.
        <pre>
          /* c-style */

          // c++ style
        </pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
      Functions and variables should be named using underscores to separate
      distinct sections of the name, rather than camel humps.  ie:
      <pre>
        uint8 acceptable_var_name;

        uint8 unaccessableVarName;
      </pre>
      </li>

      <li>
      Text should be wrapped at 100 characters (although 80 characters is also
      acceptable wrap width).  This can be accomplished with
      ':set textwidth=100' in vim.
      </li>
    </ul>
