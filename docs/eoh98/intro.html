<p><font face="Arial">The FishNet was created as a way for SigOps members to demonstrate
the operating systems they have individually written from /scratch.&nbsp; The DFP
(Distributed Fish Protocol 2.1) was developed by SigOps for this reason.&nbsp; The point
of this project, however, is not to create just a distributed fishtank, but to demonstrate
how these original operating systems can work together as well as with established
environments.&nbsp; Although at first glance the graphics may be the most impressive
component, try to imagine what lies under the surface...&nbsp; Each person had to create a
complete environment for the system.&nbsp; Everything that can be taken for granted when
you code had to be designed and implemented.&nbsp; From virtual memory subsystems to
network stacks, everything is hand-crafted.&nbsp; Most of these systems are fully 32-bit
multitasking operating systems, however, there is a huge variety in design philosophies.
&nbsp; Each person has incorporated their own method of loading and executing
applications, memory management, protection schemes, inter-process communication, etc...</font></p>
