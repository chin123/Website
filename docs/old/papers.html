<title>White Papers to Read</title>
<p>
Remember, the goal of these readings is to categorize the papers, and to
spark discussion at future meetings.  So don't worry if you don't understand
everything about the paper, just get the gist of it and bring up the unclear
points at the next meeting.  We're all learning.
