<TR><TD><BR><HR><B>The Entry Point</B><BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>In applications programming, the main() function is usually described
as the first function to receive control.  However, the real entry
is a function called _start(), and is typically defined by crt1.o.
This _start() sets up the environment, opens the default descriptors,
and then calls the application's main() function.  But for an
operating system, there isn't any crt1.o (at least, not yet),
and so you will need to supply your own _start function as the
entry point, instead of main().
</p>

<p>In the the first loaded file (which should be a statically
linked executable), our boot loader expects a declaration of
_start as follows:

<pre><code>

void _start(int memSize,  /* total amount of memory installed in bytes */
            char *parms,  /* ASCIIZ string typed at the boot prompt */
            struct boot_dir *loadedfiles);

</code></pre>
The last parameter, <code>loadedfiles</code>, is struct of
type <code>boot_dir</code> which is a structure that contains an array
of "file" objects that contain pointers to the individual files.  A
description of the <a href="../rsrc/boot.html">bootloader system</a>
is a must look at to get the os
properly booted.
</p>

<p>You need to compile your kernel into either an ELF
executable format.  The raw kernel file will always be loaded at
0x100000 (1MB), so the text and data segment locations in the file
need to coincide with their locations in memory.  For ELF, specifying
the options '-dN -Ttext 0x100080' to ld will assign space to common
symbols in the file, merge the text and data segments, and start
the text segment immediately after the header (which is where it
is in the file anyway).  For the new uBoot system, the entry point needs
to be at 0x101080 because the first 4K is taken by the boot directory entry
Note that the linker does not have
to create the output binary in this way;  however, for reasons
of simplicity, the boot loader does not actually interpret the
kernel binary.

<p>
The easiest way to return to DOS is simply to leave the _start()
function.  However, this may not be possible in an exception
handler before you have context switching.  So, an alternative
method (and also a very messy one) is to save the frame pointer
(%ebp) in the _start() function to a global variable, and then
restore that value <b>plus 4</b> to the stack register (%esp),
immediately followed by a return.  This looks like this:

<ul><li>To save %ebp (must be in the _start function):
<pre>
<code>asm ("mov %%ebp, %0":"=m" (oldEBP));</code>
</pre>
<li>To return to the bootloader:
<pre>
<code>asm ("mov %0, %%esp; ret": :"r" (oldEBP + 4));</code>
</pre>
</ul>

where oldEBP is declared as a global unsigned integer.
