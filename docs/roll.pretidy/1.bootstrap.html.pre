<h2>Decide on your bootstrap strategy</h2>

<p>How you are going to boot your new OS is going to vastly vary 
depending on the architecture you are using.  Here is how to use the 
SigOps uBoot system on a variety of architectures.  The uBoot system is a 
great resource provided by us that can get you off the ground and going 
right away.  The concept is simple, compile to elf or object files 
and create a SBBB (SigOps Bitchin' Boot Block) boot image using 
bootmaker, then boot using the method of your choice.  Here is the <a 
href="../rsrc/boot.html">technical documentation</a> for the uBoot system.  
The source is available as well.  (sorry, not yet available).</p>

<hr>
<p>Here are the components of the uBoot system and what they do for you:
<ul>
<li><a href="../rsrc/boot.html#boot.com">boot.com</a>:  This is a boot 
loader that will load a SBBB from a machine 
running DOS in real mode.  Here is some more <a href="1.c.html">technical 
information</a> about the boot loader. 
(<a href="boot/boot.com">Download</a>) (Source)
<li><a href="../rsrc/boot.html#bootmaker">bootmaker</a>:  a unix utility 
that packages up object files into a SBBB 
image.  use the -floppy flag to make an image that includes a boot sector 
and is ready to be raw written to disk and booten (for the PC 
architecture only, sorry) (Download <a href="code/bootmaker.aix">AIX</a> 
<a href="code/bootmaker.sun">sun</a> <a 
href="code/bootmaker.linux">linux</a>) (Source)
<li><a href="../rsrc/boot.html#netboot">netboot</a>: a unix utility to 
send a SBBB image to a remote computer. (Download <a 
href="code/netboot.aix">AIX</a> <a href="code/netboot.sun">sun</a> <a 
href="code/netboot.linux">linux</a>) (Source)
<li>netrom.bin: this image can be burned onto an EPROM and put on an ISA 
NE2000 network card to boot off of.  it will automaticlly RARP for it's 
IP, so make sure you setup a RARP server.  (<a 
href="code/netrom.bin">Download</a>) (Source)
<li>netboot.bin: this is an image that can be booted with boot.com to 
enter the netboot system.  (<a href="code/netboot.bin">Download</a>) (Source)
</ul></p>

<p>How does booting work on various architectures you ask?  Here's how:
<ul>
<li>i386<ul>
<li>from DOS in "real" mode transfer the image to the test bed through 
some means such as FTP or NFS (using a DOS client such as 
<a href="ftp://spam.acm.uiuc.edu/pub/sigops/xfs191.zip">XFS v1.91</a>.  
then boot using boot.com.
<li>from DOS enter the netboot system using boot.com and send the image 
from a remote system.
<li>from the boot secter of a floppy with an image constructed with 
<code>bootmaker -floppy</code>.
<li>from a boot ROM enter the netboot system.
</ul>

</ul></ul>
