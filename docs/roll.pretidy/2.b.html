<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>Modern processors are able to detect and possibly recover from 
serious faults in executable code.  Programs that access
unmanaged memory (or write to read-only memory), divide by 
zero, execute invalid 
instructions, or other major faults caught by the processor
are transferred to an <i>exception handler</i>, usually provided by
the operating system.  The exception handler is at least responsible 
for stopping the program from causing any more damage (usually by
killing the process), and fixing the problem if possible.

<p>Hardware interrupts and system calls are also typically managed with the
same processor mechanisms as exceptions.</p>
