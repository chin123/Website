<i>How to Write an Operating System</i></center></h3>

<h2>Reason for Being</h2>

<p>Up until this point, we have just been working with the operating 
system kernel.  However, an operating system is only useful in that
it will support a variety of different application programs (often at
the same time).  

<p>To that end, the kernel needs to be separated from the application
programs it's running, for both generality and protection.  
</p>

<h2>Application Loading</h2>

The operating system kernel needs some way of loading processes into memory.
Usually this requires knowledge of a filesystem and hardware driver, which 
is a big hurdle, but luckily, the boot loader for this project can load 
additional files.  Your kernel merely needs to interpret the binary format
and start executing the code.

<h4>ELF Specification</h4>

ELF is much more complex than just a header that confirms the format
and tells you where to jump.  For more information, get this
<a href="papers/elf11g.ps.gz">technical specification</a>.

<h2>Application Execution</h2>

Still under construction.
