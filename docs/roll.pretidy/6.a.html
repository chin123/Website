<h3><center>the first part of the sixth chapter in our series 
on <i>How to Write an Operating System</i></center></h3>

<hr>

<p>Dijkstra defined two operations that can be performed on semaphores:

<ul>
<li>P(semaphore):  increments the value of the semaphore, preventing the
associated resource from being used by too many processes.  If the
value of the semaphore is already too high, this operation typically
blocks.

<li>V(semaphore):  decrements the value of the semaphore, releasing the
resource for another process to use.
</ul>

<p>An important thing to remember is that these operations are 
<b>atomic</b>, meaning that they either run to completion or they 
will not change the state of the machine.  For example, a process might
want to guarantee that it is the only one using a disk drive 
(otherwise confusion would result).  So it would try to P() the 
drive's mutex (mutual-exclusion) semaphore:

<pre><code>void P(char *sem) {
   while (*sem > 0)
       wait();              // release control to another application

   *sem = 1;
}
</code></pre>
    
<p>This would work fine in an environment with no interruptions.  
However, in an environment with preemptive multitasking, the process could 
get interrupted after the while() loop exits (the semaphore is zero) but
before it sets the semaphore, and another process could P() the semaphore 
and start using the disk drive.  Then, when this process is resumed, 
it sets the semaphore and returns, thinking that it has exclusive use of 
the drive.  Now both processes are using the drive.
</p>

<p>So how do we avoid this?  By using an atomic operation designed for
such a purpose.  
If the kernel is non-interruptable, a system call will suffice to
ensure that P() reliably blocks and waits on the semaphore.  However,
system calls are expensive, and this method may not even be good enough
if the kernel itself needs to be preemptible (for instance, in a real-time
system). </P>

<p>All modern computers have some method of ensuring atomicity;  the basic
building block for ensuring atomicity is the <b>test-and-set</b> or 
<b>exchange</b> operation that atomically reads and writes to a 
location in memory.  Then, the code to P() a mutex semaphore looks like:

<pre><code>void P(char *sem) {
   while (!testAndSet(sem))
       wait();       // relinquish control to another process
}
</code></pre>

Of course, this only works for mutex semaphores.  A semaphore that
allowed several processes access to the same resource would most likely
wrapper its P() and V() operations in a mutex semaphore of its own.
