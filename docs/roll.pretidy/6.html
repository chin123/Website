<h2>Your Mission</h2>

Implement a mechanism (perhaps several) for 
<a href="6.a.html">interprocess communication</a>, and start two 
dependent tasks that use this mechanism to effectively cooperate.  Run 
the two tasks in different address spaces.  

Analyze
the system to see if any race conditions exist or if deadlock
could result if the system is interrupted at any random moment.
