The type of I/O mechanism that needs to be used by a particular driver
is entirely defined by the specific hardware device's interface.  Some 
devices do provide a multitude of different access methods, and you have 
some flexibility in determining which method best suits your system.  

<h2>Memory Mapped I/O</h2>

<p>The simplest way of device-processor communication is <i>memory mapped
I/O</i>.  By allocating portion(s) of its physical address space to
devices, the architecture allows communication with devices as though
they were a part of main memory.  Using memory mapped I/O is as
simple as using straight memory accesses (via pointers in C), with 
perhaps some timing differences thrown in.

<p>Some architectures also have an <i>I/O address space</i> separate from 
the usual address space, which reduces the loss of physical address space
but complicates driver programming and makes some device I/O 
inaccessible from standard C.  These platforms require the driver 
programmer to use inline assembly macros or functions to read from 
and write to the I/O address space.

<h2>Interrupts</h2>

<p>Modern architectures have a small number of available <i>hardware
interrupts</i> that devices can use to interrupt the processor when
they are ready to be attended to.

<h2>Direct Memory Access (DMA)</h2>

<p>Transferring data to and from devices has in the past been a very
time-consuming operation.  To solve this problem (and relinquish
the processor for other tasks), computer designers used a 
<i>Direct Memory Access</i>, or DMA, controller, that has access to
the memory bus and some devices in the computer specifically
designed to use it.  The processor can then tell the controller
to transfer
