<h2>Interrupts</h2>

<p>Modern architectures have a small number of available <i>hardware
interrupts</i> that devices can use to interrupt the processor when
they are ready to be attended to.  This is very useful, if not neccessary
because it aliviates the need to loop while polling devices.  With interupts
instead of a loop which keeps asking the keyboard if its ready until it is
you can have the keyboard tell you when input is ready while your OS is doing
whatever it pleases.
