<h2>The Development Machines</h2>

<p> <a href="http://www.uiuc.edu/ph/www/swetland">Brian Swetland</a> has
graciously installed the 
<a href="http://www.fsf.org/gnu">GNU development tools</a>
on the ACM cluster, configured to cross-compile to the i386 in 
ELF format.  
Do not use spam for development, it is very slow.  Instead use AIX 
sleepless where they are under <code>/develop/xdev/bin</code>, with names
like gcc386, g++386, ld386, and as386; or even faster, use sun wilbur 
where they are under <code>/extra/sigops/xdev386</code>.  Note also that 
the netboot and bootmaker utilities are also installed in thoose 
respective locations.</p>

<h2>The Test Machines</h2>

<p>Thanks to Brian Swetland and Douglas Armstrong, ACM has two bare 
bones i386 PCs in the office for use as test beds for operating system 
development and we hope to get a sun possibly soon.  maggie.acm.uiuc.edu has 
8MB of RAM, VGA, a hard drive, and a network card.  This machine has DOS, 
a DOS NFS client called 
<a href="ftp://spam.acm.uiuc.edu/pub/sigops/xfs191.zip">XFS v1.91</a>,
and the <a href="boot/boot.com">boot loader</a>. The ACM cluster 
conveniently exports its /scratch directory to drive G on this machine.  
This machine can also be booted using a boot disk to use the advanced 
netboot system and RARP it's IP.  The other machine, called 
krusty.acm.uiuc.edu has no hard drive or floppy hooked up; instead it 
uses the boot rom system and boot directly from the network (NE2000) card 
 ready to recieve the operating system of your choice.</p>
