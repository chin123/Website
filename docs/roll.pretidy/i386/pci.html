<h2>Configuration Mechanism One</h2>

<p>The PCI spec originally defined two configuration mechanisms for i386
PCs.  Later specs have done away with Configuration Mechanism Two.
</p>

<p>Configuration Mechanism One has two IO port rages associated with it.  The
address port (0xcf8-0xcfb) and the data port (0xcfc-0xcff).  A configuration
cycle consists of writing to the address port to specify which device and
register you want to access and then reading or writing the data to the
data port.</p>
