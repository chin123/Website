Assorted various notes that we would tell you if we were in the office,
but we may not be there right now.

First off, the netscape button does not work.  Instead type "netscape &" at
the command prompt (xterm).

Second, if you can't find bootmaker or netboot, they are in the
/develop/xdev/bin/  for AIX and 
/extra/sigops/bin   on Sun

Third, machines you probably want to use.  All of the AIX machines work with
the provided Makefile, the Sun wilbur.acm.uiuc.edu requires changes to the
Makefile.  Omgea is the Alpha in the office and does not have the proper
compilers right now:(  I would suggest using sleepless.acm.uiuc.edu, in the 
back room, becasue it is the fastest AIX machine.

Lastly, to actually netboot a kernel image, after running it through bootmaker,
the test computers have the wrong ip addresses currently because we just
changed networks that ACM lives on.  So to change the ip, first hit the esc
key to break to the prompt and type ip=<some valid ip>
at the prompt and then type go and the machine will flash real cool like.
Where the last sentance says <some valid ip> type the ip that is on a little
ripped yellow sheet of paper above or near the test machines:)  Then just
use netboot to boot it up.

That is all
Dave
