            <blockquote>
              Minimally, you need the following: 

              <ul>
                <li>a <b>development machine</b> with compilation, debugging,
                and support tools installed for the target system.</li>

                <li>a <b>test machine</b> of the same type as your target
                system. This machine houses the boot loader and some
                mechanism for getting the operating system from the
                development machine.</li>

                <li>some kind of <b>connection</b> between the machines - a
                network or serial cable works best. Using a floppy drive
                would be passable but painful.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Your development and target systems could be the same
              machine, but until your operating system can host the
              development environment by itself, you will waste a good deal
              of time switching between testing and development environments
              (which oftentimes involves a reboot).</p>
