    Minimally, you need the following: 

    <ul>
      <li>a <b>development machine</b> with compilation, debugging, and
      support tools installed for the target system.</li>

      <li>a <b>test machine</b> of the same type as your target system. This
      machine houses the boot loader and some mechanism for getting the
      operating system from the development machine.</li>

      <li>some kind of <b>connection</b> between the machines - a network or
      serial cable works best. Using a floppy drive would be passable but
      painful.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Your development and target systems could be the same machine, but
    until your operating system can host the development environment by
    itself, you will waste a good deal of time switching between testing and
    development environments (which oftentimes involves a reboot).</p>
