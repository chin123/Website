      Write an Operating System</i></h3>

    <h2>Reason for Being</h2>

    <p>Up until this point, we have just been working with the operating
    system kernel. However, an operating system is only useful in that it
    will support a variety of different application programs (often at the
    same time).</p>

    <p>To that end, the kernel needs to be separated from the application
    programs it's running, for both generality and protection.</p>

    <h2>Application Loading</h2>
    The operating system kernel needs some way of loading processes into
    memory. Usually this requires knowledge of a filesystem and hardware
    driver, which is a big hurdle, but luckily, the boot loader for this
    project can load additional files. Your kernel merely needs to interpret
    the binary format and start executing the code. 

    <h4>ELF Specification</h4>
    ELF is much more complex than just a header that confirms the format and
    tells you where to jump. For more information, get this <a href=
    "papers/elf11g.ps.gz">technical specification</a>. 

    <h2>Application Execution</h2>
    Still under construction.
