    <h2>Creating a library</h2>

    <p>The standard library provides a level of abstraction to system calls
    and functionality that all operating systems should provide (according to
    the ANSI standard). For portability and consistency, an operating system
    should provide access to functions in the <a href=
    "http://www.infosys.utas.edu.au/info/documentation/C/CStdLib.html">C
    standard library</a>, at least at some level. This is usually done
    through either <b>static</b> or <b>shared libraries</b>, which can be
    created with the <code>ar</code> command:</p>
<pre>
<code>ar vq libc.a strlen.o strcpy.o</code>
</pre>
    for example. 

    <p>Then, when linking applications for use by your kernel, specify that
    it should statically link (for now, until your operating system can
    handle shared libraries) the application with your standard library:</p>
<pre>
<code>ld -o app.elf app.o -lc</code>
</pre>
