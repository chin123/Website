    <h2>Interrupts</h2>

    <p>Modern architectures have a small number of available <i>hardware
    interrupts</i> that devices can use to interrupt the processor when they
    are ready to be attended to. This is very useful, if not neccessary
    because it aliviates the need to loop while polling devices. With
    interupts instead of a loop which keeps asking the keyboard if its ready
    until it is you can have the keyboard tell you when input is ready while
    your OS is doing whatever it pleases.</p>
