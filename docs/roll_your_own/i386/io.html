<h2>Input/Output</h2>

<p>The i386 has a seperate <b>I/O address space</b> in addition to main
physical memory.  Instead of using instructions that access memory,
however, the I/O address space requires that you use the <b>IN</b>
and <b>OUT</b> instructions to read and write it.  
</p>

<p>Using these instructions in assembly is simply a matter of knowing
the syntax and register usage.  However, communicating these to gcc 
is definitely not a trivial task.  
<a href="http://www.linux.org">Linux</a> has a pretty decent set of 
macros for inputting a byte from a port (a port is an I/O address) and
outputting a byte to a port.  gcc doesn't do type-checking on macros,
but their definitions would look like this:

<pre><code>void outb_p(unsigned char val, unsigned int port);  /* pausing version */
void outb(unsigned char val, unsigned int port);
unsigned char inb_p(unsigned int port);             /* pausing version */
unsigned char inb(unsigned int port);
</code></pre>

There are two versions of each routine, one that runs at full speed, and
one that pauses slightly after each access.  Normally, you don't need
to use the pausing versions, but there are certain chips and devices
that require it (like the PIC).  I'll point these out as they come up.
</p>

<p>Remember that 
<a href="ftp://ftp.acm.uiuc.edu/pub/sigops/io.h">the header file</a>
that defines these macros is Linus Torvald's work, and should be 
recognized as such.
