<hr>

<h2>Page Size</h2>
<p>The i386 has a 4GB (32 bit) address space, consisting of 1,024,576 
(1MB) possible 4k pages.</p>
</p>

<h2>Page Tables</h2>

<p>The i386 uses a multi-level page table scheme with two levels.  The
Page Directory (or topmost Page Table) is pointed to by the 
<a href="#PDBR">CR3 register</a>.
The Page Directory and all Page Tables must be page-aligned and use
up an entire page; they have 1024 entries of 32-bits (4 bytes)
apiece.</p>

<p>Each of the 1024 entries in the Page Directory points to a Page Table,
which maps a linear 4MB (1024 pages) of the address space.</p>

<p>A page table entry is 32-bits wide and looks like this:</p>

<img src="ptentry.gif" alt="Page table entry">

<ul>
<li>P: Present bit.  1 if the page is present in memory, 0 if not.  All other 
bits are not meaningful to the processor if the P bit is 0 (they can be
used as a reference to the page's location in mass storage.

<li>R/W:  Read/Write bit.  1 if the page is writable, 0 if read-only.

<li>U/S:  User/Supervisor bit.  1 if the page is user accessible, 0 if not.

<li>D: Dirty bit.  1 if the page has been written to, 0 if not.
<li>A: Accessed bit.  1 if the page has been accessed, 0 if not.
<li>AVAIL: 3 bits available for the operating system's use.
</ul>

<p>For the page to be user-accessible, the U/S bit must be 1 for both
the page and the page table itself.</p>

<h2>Identity Mapping Page Tables</h2>

<p>Since the page directory has the same format as a page table, it can
be mapped into itself.  This very conveniently makes the entire page table
appear to be 4MB of continous linear memory.  The page entry for any 
logical address can then be accessed with:

<pre><code>unsigned int *getPageEntry(unsigned int address)
{
   unsigned int *pageTable = (unsigned int *) 0xffc00000;

   /* 0xffc00000 is the valid address if the page directory was mapped 
      into the last entry of itself 
   */ 

   return &pageTable[address >> 12];
}
</code></pre>

which returns the address of the entry, for reading and modification.</p>

<h2>Page Faults</h2>

<p>On the i386, exception 14 is used for page faults and other virtual
memory exceptions.  The associated error code will tell you the exact
cause of the exception:

<img src="pferr.jpg" alt="Page fault error code">

<ul>
<li>P: If 0, the page fault is due to a Page Not Present.
<li>R/W: If 0, the access was a read; if 1, the access was a write.
<li>U/S: If 0, the accessing program was in supervisor mode (CPL 0,1,2); 
if 1, it was in user mode.
</ul>

<p>The CR2 register always holds the exact location of the last page 
fault, and can be read using the following C function:</p>

<pre><code>unsigned int getCR2(void) {
    unsigned int _cr2;
 
    asm ("mov %%cr2, %0":"=r" (_cr2):);
    return _cr2;
}
</code></pre>

<a name="PDBR"><h2>The Page Directory Base Register (PDBR)</h2></a>

<p>Control Register 3 (CR3) is often referred to as the Page Directory 
Base Register (PDBR).  This 32-bit register contains the physical
address of a page, which should be a Page Directory (if paging is
turned on, and CR3 is set to an invalid or uninitialized page 
directory, the machine will most likely suffer an unrecoverable
fault, since all memory references have just been yanked out
from under it).</p>

Routines for setting and reading the current value of CR3 follow:

<pre><code>void setCR3(unsigned int pagedir)
{
   asm ("mov %0, %%cr3": :"r" (pagedir));
}

unsigned int getCR3(void)
{
   unsigned int _cr3;

   asm ("mov %%cr3, %0":"=r" (_cr3));
   return _cr3;
}
</code></pre>
