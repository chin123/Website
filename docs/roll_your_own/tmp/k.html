Operating System</i></center></h3>

<h2>Your Mission</h2>

<ul>
<li>Plan out a basic design for your kernel, including what you want it to 
handle and what interface it should have for applications.  

<li>Write a polling <a href="kbinfo.html">keyboard</a> driver (using
Linux's <a href="ftp://ftp.acm.uiuc.edu/pub/sigops/io.h">I/O header file</a>) 
and a routine to display keyboard scan codes for keys pressed.

<li>Check to make sure that your video and keyboard drivers are consistent
with your operating system design.
</ul>

<h2>Kernel structure</h2>

A minimal kernel usually handles the following things:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://pandonia.canberra.edu.au/OS/l7_1.html">Memory management</a>
<li>Task switching
<li>Interprocess communication
<li>Input/Output (Devices, Interrupts, DMA)
</ul>

Things to think about when designing your operating system:

<li>Exo-kernel
</ul>
<li>Memory model 
<ul>
<li>Single-address space

<li>Virtual memory
</ul>
<li>Process model (processes, threads)
<ul>
<li>Processes vs. Threads
<li>Scheduling algorithms
<li>Real-time
<li>Synchronization (IPC) mechanisms
</ul>
<li>Device model (streams)
<ul>
<li>streams
<li>Privileged and Protected
</ul>
<li>Application/Kernel interface(s) (system calls)
<ul>
<li>System calls
<li>shared libraries
<li>object-oriented
</ul>
<li>Interprocess communication mechanisms
<li>Protection and Security
<ul>
<li>Filesystem support
<li>Multi-user vs. single-user
<li>Passwords and Encryption 
</ul>
<li>Networking
<ul>
<li>Distributed systems
</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Memory Allocation</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~zorn/Malloc.html">Ben Zorn's page</a> of malloc()/free() implementations
</ul>

<h2>Input/Output</h2>

<p>The i386 has a seperate I/O address space in addition to main
physical memory.  Instead of using instructions that access memory,
however, the I/O address space requires that you use the <b>IN</b>
and <b>OUT</b> instructions to read and write it.  
</p>

<p>Using these instructions in assembly is simply a matter of knowing
the syntax and register usage.  However, communicating these to gcc 
is definitely not a trivial task.  Linux has a pretty decent set of 
macros for inputting a byte from a port (a port is an I/O address) and
outputting a byte to a port.  gcc doesn't do type-checking on macros,
but their definitions look like this:

<pre><code>
void outb_p(unsigned char val, unsigned int port);  /* pausing version */
void outb(unsigned char val, unsigned int port);
unsigned char inb_p(unsigned int port);             /* pausing version */
unsigned char inb(unsigned int port);
</code></pre>

There are two versions of each routine, one that runs full speed, and
one that pauses slightly after each access.  Normally, you don't need
to use the pausing versions, but there are certain chips and devices
that require it (like the PIC).  I'll point these out as they come up.
</p>

<p>Remember that 
<a href="ftp://ftp.acm.uiuc.edu/pub/sigops/io.h">the header file</a>
that creates these macros is Linus Torvald's work, and should be 
recognized as such.
