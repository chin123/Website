<h3><center>the first chapter in our series on <i>How to Write an 
Operating System</i></center></h3>

<hr>
<h2>Your Mission</h2>

<ul>
<li>Create a basic C (or C++) program to print "Hello World!" anywhere
on the screen.  
<li>Write an output driver to handle displaying text, numbers, 
addresses, and more, as well as scrolling the display.
</ul>

<p>
Use the sample 
<a href="ftp://ftp.acm.uiuc.edu/pub/sigops/Makefile.gcc">Makefile for C</a> or
<a href="ftp://ftp.acm.uiuc.edu/pub/sigops/Makefile.g++">Makefile for C++</a>
to compile it and the 
<a href="ftp://ftp.acm.uiuc.edu/pub/sigops/boot.com">boot loader</a> to 
run it.  You will need to know how to access the PC's 
<a href="#vidmem">video card</a> to display text on the screen.  
</p>

<h2>Development Environment</h2>

Ideally, you would have the following resources (maybe more):

<ul>
<li>a <b>fast machine</b> for compiling and/or debugging 
<li>another <b>machine for testing</b> (at least one) - This can be 
the same as your
machine for compiling, but plan to spend a good deal of your time
rebooting and switching between testing and compiling environments.  And
when things go seriously awry (as they are wont to do in systems
development), you won't be able to tell what went wrong because the
state of the machine (including display and memory) is nuked.

<li>an <b>In-Circuit Emulator (ICE)</b> - an invaluable tool for operating
systems programming.  However, since these are very expensive (around
$10,000 for an i386 version), they aren't available to everyone.  Too bad.
<li>some kind of <b>connection</b> between the machines - a network or serial
cable works best.  Using a floppy drive would be passable but painful, and it
also suffers from the same debugging problems that you would have with only
one machine, but at least you have a stable development environment.
<li>a good <b>compiler</b> - We'll be using the GNU C compiler (gcc).
<li><b>architecture references</b>- For some platforms, these are easy to come
across; for others, they are impossible.  Not coincidentally, SigOPS will
show you how to develop for the i386, about which exist a plethora of great
books.
</ul>

<p>Our development environment consists of the ACM cluster and a random
PC connected to the network.  
<p> <a href="http://www.uiuc.edu/ph/www/swetland">Brian Swetland</a> has
graciously installed gcc/g++ on the cluster, configured to cross-compile
to the i386 in ELF format.  Currently, the cluster NFS exports its /scratch
directory to a test PC (also in the ACM office); we may be able to export
it to other machines on campus if we ask nice enough.  The test PC is
running DOS and a DOS NFS client called XFS.  We don't have access to 
an ICE, but we do have some good i386 architectural references in the 
office; I'll point these out to you at the meetings.
</p>

<p>Setting up your own development environment is pretty painless as
well.  Getting a PC for compilation and installing Linux and gcc/g++ on it
is recommended (this is probably the easiest way), and you can 
<a href="ftp://spam.acm.uiuc.edu/pub/sigops/xfs191.zip">Download XFS v1.91 for DOS</a>
for the test machine.

<h2>Boot Loader</h2>
<p>What does a boot loader need to do?
<ul>
<li>Load enough of the operating system to get it running.
<li>Prepare the environment for the operating system.
<li>Start the operating system.
</ul>

<h2>What The Boot Loader Gives You</h2>

The bootloader puts the machine into 32-bit protected mode and turns on
paging.  For your pleasure, it:

<ul>
<li>loads all the files on the command line
<li>gives you access to all of memory (up to 252MB worth)
<li>creates a boot stack (for function calls and local variables)
<li>creates a boot page table, with identity mapped memory (so it looks like 
you're in physical memory mode), EXCEPT for page 0 (this is used to catch 
null references).
</ul>

<h2>What You Need to Give the Boot Loader</h2>

<p>
You will need to supply a _start function (declared C style; if you're
using the C++ version you need to declare it 'extern "C"') in the first 
file (which should be an i386-ELF32 executable), declared as follows:

<pre><code>
struct file {
   char *ptr;           /* address of the loaded file */
   unsigned int len;    /* length of the file in bytes */
};

void _start(int memSize,  /* total amount of memory installed in bytes */
            char *parms,  /* ASCIIZ string typed at the boot prompt */
            struct file *loadedfiles);

</code></pre>

The last parameter, <code>loadedfiles</code>, is an array of <code>struct file</code>.
This represents all the files that were loaded by the bootloader, including 
the one it passes control to.  The last item in the array will be NULL 
<code>(loadedfiles[lastitem].ptr == NULL)</code>.
</p>

<p>You need to compile your kernel into either an i386-ELF or a.out 
executable format.  The raw kernel file will always be loaded at 
0x100000 (1MB), so the text and data segment locations in the file
need to coincide with their locations in memory.  For ELF, specifying 
the options '-dN -Ttext 0x100080' to ld will assign space to common
symbols in the file, merge the text and data segments, and start
the text segment immediately after the header (which is where it
is in the file anyway).  For a.out, '-dN -Ttext 0x100020' works
as well, for the same reasons.  Note that the linker does not have
to create the output binary in this way;  however, for reasons
of simplicity, the boot loader does not actually interpret the 
kernel binary.
</p>

<a name="vidmem"><h2>Video Memory Structure</h2></a>

<p>The text mode video screen in the PC is memory-mapped to physical address 
<b>0xb0000</b> on monochrome adapters and <b>0xb8000</b> on color adapters.
(Our PCs all have color adapters, and most likely any machine you find will
too.  I merely include the monochrome adapter information for completeness).
</p>

<p>
You can access a specific physical address in the PC by merely assigning
it to a pointer, and then treating the pointer as a reference to an
array.  Assigning a numeric value to a pointer is just a matter of using
a cast:

<pre><code>char *vidmem = (char *) 0xb8000;</code></pre>

The text mode is 80 columns by 25 rows, with 2 bytes per character
that appears on the screen.  The first byte is the ASCII value of 
the character itself, and the second is the attribute byte.  0x07 is 
white on black, and works fine.  You may want to experiment with 
other colors.
</p>
