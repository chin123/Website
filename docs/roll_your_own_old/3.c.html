<h2>The Concept</h2>

<p>Writing or porting a debugger to a new operating system is a 
difficult and lengthy process, and most likely you will want to
use a debugger well before you're ready to host one.  It would be
great if you could use <i>gdb</i> or a similar debugger running
on another machine, while your operating system ran on the target
machine.</p>

<h2>Setting Up the Remote Debugging Environment</h2>

<p>On the debugging (host) machine, you need to:

<ul>
<li>install a copy of 
<a href="ftp://uiarchive.cso.uiuc.edu/pub/gnu/gdb-4.16.tar.gz">gdb</a>,
compiled to cross-debug for the i386;
<li>setup the serial port to run at 9600 bps, 8/N/1, raw; and
<li>plug in one end of a serial cable.
</ul>

On the target kernel and machine, you need to:

<ul>
<li>compile and link 
<a href="i386-stub.c">i386-stub.c</a> and 
<a href="gdb.c">gdb stub routines</a> into the kernel; and
<li>add the <code>init_serial();</code> and <code>set_debug_traps();</code> 
calls to the kernel, to be executed after you set up the IDT.
</ul>

<p>The i386-stub.c file has been slightly modified to clean up unresolved
references and comment out some unimplemented libc functions (namely, 
fprintf() and printf()).</p> 

<p>The gdb stub routines that you need to provide have been partially 
provided for you.  They include polling serial routines to read and write
a character, and a routine to flush the instruction cache (just a short
jmp).  You still need to fill in the exceptionHandler() and memset() 
routines, and feel free to rewrite any part of the example stub
routines.
</p>

<h2>Using the Remote Debugger</h2>

<p>Once you have the debug traps installed and working correctly, your 
operating system will appear to hang whenever it encounters an exception.
However, it is merely waiting in the polling serial driver for a 
response from the host machine.  To debug the kernel in this state,
start up the gdb cross-debugger (gdb386 on the ACM cluster), and at 
the prompt, type:
<pre><code>target remote /dev/tty0</code></pre>

where /dev/tty0 is the name of the serial port on the host machine. 
gdb will then try to connect to the target machine, and if all goes
well it will display where the fault occurred.  You can then use
gdb just as though you were debugging a local program.
</p>
