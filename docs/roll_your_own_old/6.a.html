<h3><center>the first part of the sixth chapter in our series

<hr>

<p>The <a href="1.a.html">boot loader</a> defines a handful of 
segments, some of which are for kernel mode and some of which are
for user mode.  </p>

<p>Since you can't call user level code from the kernel, the only way 
to enter user mode is by setting up the context with user 
<a href="regs.html#segments">segments</a>.  All six of the segment
registers in the <a href="systbl.html#tss">Task State Segment</a>
need to be set to the appropriate user segments.
