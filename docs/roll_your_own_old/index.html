<H1><CENTER>How to Write an Operating System</center></h1>

<p>This semester SigOPS will hold a series of meetings discussing how
to build an operating system from scratch.  We provide the structure
for developing your Very Own OS, you write the code.  It's that simple!
</p>

<h2>The Plan</h2>
<p>What follows is an outline of the next dozen or so SigOPS meetings
this semester.  We'll be posting all the critical information on these
here web pages, so if you miss one (or have missed everything up to
this point), no need to worry.  Just catch up and come to the next
meeting.</p>
<p>Hopefully, any SigOPS member who wants to write an operating system
will have done so by the end of this excursion.  Stay tuned for information
and updates on our progress!</p>
