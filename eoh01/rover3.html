<H4>
The internet rover is a remote controlled car that can be steered and
<img src=silverado4.BMP ALIGN=RIGHT> 
controlled by anyone with an internet connection (probably by going
to a webpage where an applet will be installed onto the browser).  The
rover is a modified rear-wheel drive black Power Wheels Ford F150.  It has
a maximum speed
of 3.5 miles per hour both forwards and backwards and has a 65 pound
carrying capacity.  The remote user will issue commands that will be
received by our Linux notebook by wireless ethernet.  The notebook will
then transmit the instructions via serial cable to the HC11
microprocessor inside the rover.  The microprocessor then issues
instructions to the motor (for forward and backward motion) as well as the
servo to control the front wheels (for directional steering).  A
Logitech webcam
mounted to the rover will stream live video back to the remote
user.<br><p>

<H4>Any pc user can go to a certain webpage to issue instructions to the
rover.  In order to pass objects between the remote
user and our notebook, an applet will be run on the remote pc.  The
Java applet will give instructions for the user on how to use the
keyboard to send the directions.  A streaming picture will also show up 
on the screen.<p> <Br><p> </H4>

<H2><font color="#F736FFF">Notebook</H2>
<font color="#0000000">
<H4>The notebook will have Linux Red Hat 7.0 for its operating system 
and has a total (after upgrade from 32 MB) of 96 MB of memory.  It
will have 802.11b wireless ethernet capabilities <!--range of 300
feet within DCL-->through the PCMCIA
interface, a standard interface for connecting peripherals to portable
computers.  We will be using Lucent Technology's Wave LAN (Local
Area Network) adapter card.  On the download, we've seen a 252 Kb
transfer rate through the wireless ethernet.  To communicate between the
remote user and our notebook, we are implementing Remote Method Invocation
(RMI).  It is a standard for distributed objects written in Java.  RMI is
a remote procedure call (RPC), which allows Java objects stored in the
network to be run remotely.  The Java Virtual Machine, a Java interpreter,
built into the browser is interpreting the instructions.  It is software
that converts the Java intermediate language (bytecode) into machine
language and executes it.  JVM's are integrated in web browsers in order
to execute Java applets.  An applet is a small Java program that is
downloaded and run from the browser.  The remote user will run an applet
from the web server.  
The notebook will also have a serial interface for the cable going to the
serial communications interface on the HC11 on the rover.  
*current goal: install Windows 95 or higher to be able to stream video
because the driver isn't working for the Linux system.  The notebook will
route streaming video packets to the internet and handle the controlling
mechanisms for the rover.  A second notebook will have Java applications
doing the video compressions and sending it to the client, where the video
will then be decompressed.  The streaming video is a one-way transmission
of the images and uniterrupted motion from the USB webcam on the rover to 
the client.  The client side buffers a few seconds of video data
before it starts sending it through the internet, which compensates for
momentary delays in packet delivery.  The second notebook has an onboard 
LAN that allows it to communicate with our first Linux notebook.<A

HC11 Microprocessor.</a>  
It will be receiving information through the cable connceted to its 
serial communications interface (SCI).  A digital logic block will be 
taking the output from the HC11 and make it compatible with the
proprietary bidirectional current driver we are using for a motor control 
unit and the servo.  
Heat sinks attached to the protoboard prevent the
protoboard from overheating.  Two current regulators requiring a
minimum of 9 volts will also be used.  The power supply consists of four 9
volt batteries in parallel.  The HC11 has a digital converter.  Therefore,
it can read values on the position of the rover's wheels from the
potentiometer and send this feedback to the notebook. <p>

<H4><p><p>The Power Wheels car was designed for a child to sit in it and
provide manual steering.  To allow for remote control instead of manual
control, we have constructed a servo-controlled cam that converts the
rotational motion into translational or linear motion.  A servo is just 
an electromechanical device which uses feedback to provide precise starts
and stops for such functions as motors.  The
front wheels will be the ones to steer the rover left and right while the
back wheels move the rover forward and backwards.  Power steering has been
implemented on the rover.  There are two input pins: one to control the
direction (left and right) and the other to turn the rover on and off.  A
potentiometer (a variable resister) allows feedback of the position of the
wheels to be sent back.  Limit switches will prevent the wheels
from turning too far.<p><br> <p><br> <A

A current amplifier bridge or H-bridge is a device that contains a
resistor and connects two circuits.  It amplifies the input current so it
is strong enough to drive a motor as well as directs the direction of the
current.  Eight CAB's have been incorporated into the motor that came with
the Power Wheels vehicle.  The motor will drive the back wheels to go
forward and backwards.  The CABs can work with a maximum capacity of 10
amps, but for less than a second.  To safely use the CABs for the rover
which sends a maximum of 12 (during acceleration) and an average of 9
amps, we need at least 10 CABs.  Another unfortunate limitation of the
CABs are how fast and how hot they get.  To solve this problem, we will
try attaching heat sinks as well as provide a fan for them.   <p>
* We have the motor and the chassis of the vehicle.  We also have our
hands on some CAB's but we will need more, especially for backup in case
some burn out.  We are also looking for heat sinks. <br><p><br>
