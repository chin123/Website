		<h1><center>sigops linux kernel module tutorial</center></h1>
		<hr />
		<p>
		Right now, there's just example code, w/ little or no
		explanation.  Of course, contributions and comments are
		welcome (and needed!).	I especially would appreciate
		testing the examples; most of the problems that I'm
		concerned about are with the build (correct include dirs,
		compiler flags, etc).
		</p>

		<p>
		This code is all licensed under the GPL, but I haven't
		put all of the appropriate files and headers in yet that 
		mark it as such.  This code is all my own, but I did look 
		at examples from Rubini's book Linux Device Drivers and a
		few other online sources, so expect similarities.
		Hopefully, others will contribute, so that it's more of
		a sigops group project than just some of my example code.
		</p>
                <b>New Example code:</b>
		<ul>
                        <li><a href="jacarrin_tutorial/basic">basic charachter device with some locking</a></li>
                        <li><a href="jacarrin_tutorial/int_handler">really cool exception catching module</a></li>
		</ul>
                <b>Old Example code:</b>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="helloworld">The helloworld kernel module</a></li>
			<li><a href="arg_example">The arg_example kernel module</a></li>
                        <li><a href="simple_char">The simple_char kernel module</a></li>
		</ul>

		<b>Update: Another tutorial (11/05/2002)</b>
		<p>
		We have another <a href="pratap-lkm.txt">tutorial</a> graciously contributed by pratap [<a href="mailto:xtremist@hacktivismo.co">mxtremist@hacktivismo.com</a>].  It covers much of the same material as the sigops tutorial, but has some more explanation and less clutter.  I have not personally tested the code, but it's supposed to run fine on a 2.4 kernel, YMMV.  As I understand it, this tutorial is incomplete, and pratap is still working on more examples.

		<b>Update: Yet Another tutorial (10/14/2004)</b>
		<p>
                We have another tutorial contributed by John Carrino 
                It covers much of the same material, but some other things like
                polling and interrupts.
