The SIGOPS group of the ACM is currently working on an FTP filesystem.  This
filesystem will allow users and UNIX applications to access files via anonymous
FTP as if they were regular files in the filesystem.

Current Status: 10-24-96<p>

Our first order of business is to get a piece of equipment to work on.  Our current plan is to use a Sparc SLC running Linux.  We are currently trying to install Linux on the SLC.
<hr>
At our last meeting, we looked over the
<a HREF="ftp://alex.sp.cs.cmu.edu/www/alex.html">ALEX File System.</a>
  This is a similar
program that implements an FTP filesystem by using an NFS file server.
The ALEX system replaces the NFS file server with a program that translates
between the NFS and FTP protocals.
<p>

This method makes ALEX very portable, but may degrade performance.  As a
project, SIGOPS
chose to implement a similar system, but to make it a part of the kernel.
<p>

Currently, we are attempting to find equipment that we can use for this
project.  We are also investigating how a filesystem is implemented and
how to use networking from within the UNIX kernel.
