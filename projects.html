                              The internet rover is a remote controlled car that can be steered and  controlled by anyone with an internet connection (probably by going  to a webpage where an applet will be installed onto the browser).  The  rover is a modified rear-wheel drive black Power Wheels Ford F150.  It has  a maximum speed  of 3.5 miles per hour both forwards and backwards and has a 65 pound  carrying capacity.  The remote user will issue commands that will be  received by our Linux notebook by wireless ethernet.  The notebook will  then transmit the instructions via serial cable to the HC11  microprocessor inside the rover.  The microprocessor then issues  instructions to the motor (for forward and backward motion) as well as the  servo to control the front wheels (for directional steering).  A  Logitech webcam  mounted to the rover will stream live video back to the remote  user.</p></td>
