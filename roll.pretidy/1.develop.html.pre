<hr>
Minimally, you need the following:

<ul>
<li>a <b>development machine</b> with compilation, debugging, and
support tools installed for the target system.

<li>a <b>test machine</b> of the same type as your target system.  This
machine houses the boot loader and some mechanism for getting
the operating system from the development machine.

<li>some kind of <b>connection</b> between the machines - a network
or serial cable works best.  Using a floppy drive would be passable
but painful.
</ul>

<p>Your development and target systems could be the same machine, but
until your operating system can host the development environment
by itself, you will waste a good deal of time switching between
testing and development environments (which oftentimes involves
a reboot).
