<h2>Creating a library</h2>

<p>The standard library provides a level of abstraction to system calls 
and functionality that all operating systems should provide (according
to the ANSI standard).  For portability and consistency, an operating system
should provide access to functions in the 
<a href="http://www.infosys.utas.edu.au/info/documentation/C/CStdLib.html">
C standard library</a>, at least at some level.  This is usually done
through either <b>static</b> or <b>shared libraries</b>, which can be
created with the <code>ar</code> command:

<pre><code>ar vq libc.a strlen.o strcpy.o</code></pre>

for example.

<p>Then, when linking applications for use by your kernel, specify that
it should statically link (for now, until your operating system can
handle shared libraries) the application with your standard library:

<pre><code>ld -o app.elf app.o -lc</code></pre>
