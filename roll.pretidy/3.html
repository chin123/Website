<h2>Your Mission</h2>

<ul>
<li>Write an application program for your OS to 
<a href="3.b.html">load and execute</a>.  Then, interface the application
to the kernel via some simple 
<a href="3.a.html">system calls</a> and write a few
of the simpler calls.  

<li>Use the i386's <a href="i386/io.html">I/O address space</a> to extend 
your video driver to 
<a href="hardware/text.html#cursor">video driver</a> to move 
the cursor as you output text.


<li>Now would also be a good time to start work on the system
<a href="3.c.html">standard library</a>.
