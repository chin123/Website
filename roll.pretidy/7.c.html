<h2>PCI</h2>

<H3>Overview</H3>
<p>A friend once said that "hardware engineers live to make software engineers
lives hell."  PCI is on of the exceptions that actually works in a usefull
manner.  In most architecture the PCI bridge handles most everything such
as Memory Mapped IO, DMA, and I/O ports it you are on a PC.  All that you
don't have to worry too much about except for configuring it.</p>

<p>PCI, also, provides an intellegent configuration mechanism.  Each device
has either 64 or 256 bytes of configuration space.  The 64 bytes are a 
<A HREF="7.c.0.html">standard header format</A>.  The last 192 bytes are 
left for device specific configureation.  By the time your OS boot the
BIOS/Firmware will have set most of the important information such as IRQ and 
IO address.  Your OS need only read these values and start using them.  
Thats right no jumpers.  No probing.  Does it get any better than this?</p>

<H3>Addresses in PCI</H3>
<p>PCI has a special way of representing addresses when dealing with the
config space.  Values not only include location but address type 
(memory/io) and various other flags.  The two formats are as follows:</P>
