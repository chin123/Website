<h2>The Development Machine</h2>

<p> <a href="http://www.uiuc.edu/ph/www/swetland">Brian Swetland</a> has
graciously installed the 
<a href="http://www.fsf.org/gnu">GNU development tools</a>
on the ACM cluster, configured to cross-compile to the i386 in 
ELF format.  All of these tools are available in 
<code>/develop/xdev/bin</code>, with names
like gcc386, g++386, ld386, and as386.
</p>

<h2>The Test Machine</h2>

<p>ACM also has a bare bones i386 PC in the office, with 8MB of RAM, 
VGA, a hard drive, and a network card.  Appropriately named 
krusty.acm.uiuc.edu, this machine has DOS, a DOS NFS client called 
<a href="ftp://spam.acm.uiuc.edu/pub/sigops/xfs191.zip">XFS v1.91</a>,
and the 
<a href="ftp://spam.acm.uiuc.edu/pub/sigops/boot.com">boot loader</a>.
The ACM cluster conveniently exports its /scratch directory to
drive G on this machine.
</p>



<h2>Compiling the Kernel</h2>

<p>
This <a href="code/Makefile">Makefile</a> is set up to compile both
C and C++ programs for the i386.  With minor changes to the path
and tool names, you can use this same Makefile with the GNU tools
in your own development environment.
