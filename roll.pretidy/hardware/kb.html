<h2>The Keyboard</h2>

(Note:  The following information pertains directly to MF II (101-key) 
keyboards.  Its accuracy for other keyboards is imperfect.)

<p>The PC keyboard is actually interrupt driven, so you won't create a
full keyboard driver until the section on Hardware Interrupts.  
However, you can start with a simple polling driver that waits for
a key to be pressed and returns the scan code.
</p>

<p>The keyboard works through the I/O ports 0x60 and 0x64:
<br><br>
Keyboard controller registers:
<table border cols=3>
<tr><th>Port<th>Register<th>Read/Write</tr>
<tr><td>60h<td>output buffer<td>R</tr>
<tr><td>60h<td>input buffer<td>W</tr>
<tr><td>64h<td>control register<td>W</tr>
<tr><td>64h<td>status register<td>R</tr>
</table>
<br>
Status Register (I/O reads from port 64h):
<br>
<img src="kbstatus.jpg">
<table border>
<tr><td>PARE: parity error of the last byte (PS/2 only)
<li>0 = last byte without parity error
<li>1 = last byte with parity error 
</tr>
<td>TIM:  general time-out
<li>0 = no time-out error
<li>1 = error 
</td>
<tr><td>AUXB: output buffer for auxiliary device
<li>0 = holds keyboard data
<li>1 = holds auxiliary data
</tr>
<td>KEYL: keyboard lock status
<li>0 = keyboard locked
<li>1 = keyboard free
</td>
<tr><td>C/D: command/data
<li>0 = data byte written
<li>1 = command byte written
</tr>
<td>SYSF: system flag
<li>0 = power-on reset
<li>1 = self-test successful
</td>
<tr><td>INPB: input buffer status
<li>0 = input buffer empty
<li>1 = CPU data in input buffer
</tr>
<td>OUTB: output buffer state
<li>0 = output buffer empty
<li>1 = keyboard controller data in output buffer
</td>
</table>

<p>So basically, you could write a simple polling keyboard driver by sampling
the status register (port 64h) and checking OUTB (bit 0).  Whenever OUTB is
1 (data in output buffer), you can read the output buffer (port 60h) and
get the scan code.
