    <h2>Concept</h2>

    <p>The Assert() macro is a useful tool in all programming, not just in
    operating system development. However, it takes on extra importance in an
    operating system, since, without a conventional debugger, there are
    frequently no other convenient ways to fully test a system. Assert() is
    not much more than an if()/else macro, but therein lies most of its
    power. When the system is fully debugged, the Assert()s can be compiled
    out (taking up no code space and no time during execution) by turning off
    a compile-time definition.</p>

    <p>Assert() simply takes a C expression and asserts its truth. If the
    expression is true, execution continues without any noticeable
    interruption. However, if the assertion is false, the program should
    print out some debugging information and halt immediately.</p>

    <p>For example, Assert() could be used to make sure that your video
    driver is always writing to the correct area of video memory. During
    development and testing, if this is ever not the case, you will know
    immediately. When the video driver has been determined to be stable, it
    can be compiled without Assert()s at no loss.</p>

    <h2>How to write and use Assert()</h2>

    <p>Look at the example <a href="code/Assert.h">Assert.h</a> and <a href=
    "code/Assert.c">Assert.c</a> to see a standard Assert(). You won't be
    able to use this one, since it uses fprintf() and libc functions aren't
    available.</p>

    <p>Any file that uses Assert() needs to #include "Assert.h", and you need
    to add Assert.o to your list of object files. In the Makefile, add
    -DASSERT (this defines ASSERT, so that Assert()s will be evaluated) as an
    option to the compile command.</p>
