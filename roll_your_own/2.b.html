    <h2>Exceptions</h2>

    <p>Modern processors are able to detect and possibly recover from serious
    faults in executable code. Programs that access unmanaged memory (or
    write to read-only memory), divide by zero, execute invalid instructions,
    or other major faults caught by the processor are transferred to an
    <i>exception handler</i>, usually provided by the operating system. The
    exception handler is at least responsible for stopping the program from
    causing any more damage (usually by killing the process), and fixing the
    problem if possible.</p>

    <p>Hardware interrupts and system calls are also typically managed with
    the same processor mechanisms as exceptions.</p>
