    <h2>The Concept</h2>

    <p>Writing or porting a debugger to a new operating system is a difficult
    and lengthy process, and most likely you will want to use a debugger well
    before you're ready to host one. It would be great if you could use
    <i>gdb</i> or a similar debugger running on another machine, while your
    operating system ran on the target machine.</p>

    <h2>Setting Up the Remote Debugging Environment</h2>

    <p>On the debugging (host) machine, you need to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>install a copy of <a href=
      "ftp://uiarchive.cso.uiuc.edu/pub/gnu/gdb-4.16.tar.gz">gdb</a>,
      compiled to cross-debug for your target system;</li>

      <li>setup the serial port to run at 9600 bps, 8/N/1, raw; and</li>

      <li>plug in one end of a serial cable.</li>
    </ul>
    On the target kernel and machine, you need to: 

    <ul>
      <li>compile and link the <a href="#stubs">stub routines</a> for the
      target system into the kernel;</li>

      <li>add the <code>init_serial();</code> and
      <code>set_debug_traps();</code> calls to the kernel, to be executed
      after you set up exception handling; and</li>

      <li>plug in the other end of the serial cable.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The gdb stub routines that you need to provide may have been partially
    provided for you. They include polling serial routines to read and write
    a character, and a routine to flush the instruction cache (usually just a
    jmp instruction). You still need to fill in the exceptionHandler() and
    memset() routines, and feel free to rewrite any part of the example stub
    routines.</p>

    <h2>Using the Remote Debugger</h2>

    <p>Once you have the debug traps installed and working correctly, your
    operating system will appear to hang whenever it encounters an exception.
    However, it is merely waiting in the polling serial driver for a response
    from the host machine. To debug the kernel in this state, start up the
    gdb cross-debugger, and at the prompt, type:</p>
<pre>
<code>target remote /dev/tty0</code>
</pre>
    where /dev/tty0 is the name of the serial port on the host machine. gdb
    will then try to connect to the target machine, and if all goes well it
    will display where the fault occurred. You should then be able to use gdb
    just as though you were debugging a local program. <br>
     <br>
     

    <h2>For More Information</h2>
    For more information, read gdb's manual pages on <a href=
    "http://www.fnal.gov/docs/products/gcc/gdb/gdb_104.html">remote
    debugging</a> 

    <h2>Stub Routines</h2>

    <p>Stubs provided with gdb for different platforms:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="i386/code/i386-stub.c">i386</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Example stub code that needs to be tailored to your OS:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="i386/code/gdb.c">i386</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The i386-stub.c file has been slightly modified to clean up unresolved
    references and comment out some unimplemented libc functions (namely,
    fprintf() and printf()).</p>
