      <h3>the first part of the sixth chapter in our series on <i>How to
      Write an Operating System</i></h3>

    <p>Dijkstra defined two operations that can be performed on
    semaphores:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>P(semaphore): increments the value of the semaphore, preventing the
      associated resource from being used by too many processes. If the value
      of the semaphore is already too high, this operation typically
      blocks.</li>

      <li>V(semaphore): decrements the value of the semaphore, releasing the
      resource for another process to use.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>An important thing to remember is that these operations are
    <b>atomic</b>, meaning that they either run to completion or they will
    not change the state of the machine. For example, a process might want to
    guarantee that it is the only one using a disk drive (otherwise confusion
    would result). So it would try to P() the drive's mutex
    (mutual-exclusion) semaphore:</p>
<pre>
<code>void P(char *sem) {
   while (*sem &gt; 0)
       wait();              // release control to another application

   *sem = 1;
}
</code>
</pre>

    <p>This would work fine in an environment with no interruptions. However,
    in an environment with preemptive multitasking, the process could get
    interrupted after the while() loop exits (the semaphore is zero) but
    before it sets the semaphore, and another process could P() the semaphore
    and start using the disk drive. Then, when this process is resumed, it
    sets the semaphore and returns, thinking that it has exclusive use of the
    drive. Now both processes are using the drive.</p>

    <p>So how do we avoid this? By using an atomic operation designed for
    such a purpose. If the kernel is non-interruptable, a system call will
    suffice to ensure that P() reliably blocks and waits on the semaphore.
    However, system calls are expensive, and this method may not even be good
    enough if the kernel itself needs to be preemptible (for instance, in a
    real-time system).</p>

    <p>All modern computers have some method of ensuring atomicity; the basic
    building block for ensuring atomicity is the <b>test-and-set</b> or
    <b>exchange</b> operation that atomically reads and writes to a location
    in memory. Then, the code to P() a mutex semaphore looks like:</p>
<pre>
<code>void P(char *sem) {
   while (!testAndSet(sem))
       wait();       // relinquish control to another process
}
</code>
</pre>
    Of course, this only works for mutex semaphores. A semaphore that allowed
    several processes access to the same resource would most likely wrapper
    its P() and V() operations in a mutex semaphore of its own.
