    The type of I/O mechanism that needs to be used by a particular driver is
    entirely defined by the specific hardware device's interface. Some
    devices do provide a multitude of different access methods, and you have
    some flexibility in determining which method best suits your system. 

    <h2>Memory Mapped I/O</h2>

    <p>The simplest way of device-processor communication is <i>memory mapped
    I/O</i>. By allocating portion(s) of its physical address space to
    devices, the architecture allows communication with devices as though
    they were a part of main memory. Using memory mapped I/O is as simple as
    using straight memory accesses (via pointers in C), with perhaps some
    timing differences thrown in.</p>

    <p>Some architectures also have an <i>I/O address space</i> separate from
    the usual address space, which reduces the loss of physical address space
    but complicates driver programming and makes some device I/O inaccessible
    from standard C. These platforms require the driver programmer to use
    inline assembly macros or functions to read from and write to the I/O
    address space.</p>

    <h2>Interrupts</h2>

    <p>Modern architectures have a small number of available <i>hardware
    interrupts</i> that devices can use to interrupt the processor when they
    are ready to be attended to.</p>

    <h2>Direct Memory Access (DMA)</h2>

    <p>Transferring data to and from devices has in the past been a very
    time-consuming operation. To solve this problem (and relinquish the
    processor for other tasks), computer designers used a <i>Direct Memory
    Access</i>, or DMA, controller, that has access to the memory bus and
    some devices in the computer specifically designed to use it. The
    processor can then tell the controller to transfer</p>
