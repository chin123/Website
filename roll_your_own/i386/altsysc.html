<h2>Call Gates</h2>

An alternative to software interrupts is to use a <i>call gate</i> in 
the GDT.  You can refer to <i>Protected Mode Software Architecture</i>
(pp. 112-118) for more information.

<h2>Pros and Cons</h2>

<p>Software interrupts are simpler and cleaner, and they save the <i>eFlags</i>
register (which includes the interrupt flag and other status flags).  Also,
they can use either an interrupt or a trap gate, clearing interrupts or
keeping them constant.  On the downside, interrupts are slightly slower.
</p>

<p>Call gates, on the other hand, can pass an arbitrary number of arguments
(up to 31) to the system call handler.  They are slightly faster.  However, 
they require adding entries to the GDT or LDT (which have limited
space anyway).  Interrupts are always the same as they were on entry,
eFlags isn't saved, and the method of execution is a bit more complex.
</p>

<p>How to do system calls is up to you.  Both methods are acceptable and
it's just a matter of preference.
