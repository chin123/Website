<h2>Your Mission</h2>

<p>Provide the mechanism for your OS to handle 
<a href="4.a.html">system calls</a> and write one or two
of the simpler calls.  Also write a simple 
<a href="4.b.html">application program</a>
that utilizes one of these system calls, and have the OS "load" and run 
it.  Don't forget that the boot loader will actually load the file;  
the OS merely has to interpret the format and jump to the starting 
address.

<p>Now would be a good time to start work on the system
